# Welcome to My Website

Hey, my name is Andrei, or you can just call me TD. I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast and currently the President at the University of Alberta’s CHADS (Cybersecurity, Hacking, and Digital Security) student club. I live at the intersection of tech and security. This site is where I show off my work and express myself: CTF write-ups, personal projects, competition wins, and many more things. Whether I’m mentoring, competing, or climbing toward the next milestone, I always love to get after it! Always looking to hear more stories and build more relationships! 

Psst... Add me on Linkedin (;
