# Welcome to My Website

Hey, my name is Andrei, or you can just call me TD. I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast and currently the Vice President External at the University of Alberta’s CHADS (Cybersecurity, Hacking, and Digital Security) club. I live at the intersection of tech and security. This site is where I show off my work and express myself: CTF write-ups, personal projects, and competition wins. Whether I’m mentoring, competing, or climbing toward the next milestone, I always love to get after it! Always looking to hear stories and build more realtionships! 

Psst... Add me on Linkedin (;
