Consistent Growth is the name of the Game!

I remember we had competed at this same CTF earlier this year and we had placed 4th. I remember going into that CTF really hoping to place in the top 3, but we just fell a little short and placed 4th. Same CTF a few months later and that same goal still in my mind. This time around we placed 2nd!! not only that we were only 1 solve away from being 1st. Thank you to my wonderful team for pushing themselves and being a apart of where we were able to place today. As well cannot forget about the wonderful team at SAIT for voulnteering and setting up such a cool and exciting tournmant. This time around unfrotuantly we were not able to make the drive down to Calgary but still feel surreal that we were able to place in the top three. The only thing that had changed from a few months till now was practice. We had done more CTF's together as a team. Our student group at CHADS also held a CTF for students. This dedication just really shows how practice over time can really change. Maybe all roads don't lead back to rome, we simply just have to stay patient, head down, and keep working. So to those who read this and have a dream, please don't stop, never give up, You are only a hop, skip and a jump away from success. It is never as far as we think it is.

Be the Cat! not the rabbit 🐇
