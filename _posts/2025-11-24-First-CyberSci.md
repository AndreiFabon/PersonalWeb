This past weekend I had the opportunity to go on a road trip with the CHADS B-Team to compete at CyberSci! If you train BJJ you know why being on the B-Team is the best team. Anyways... I had the opportunity to compete at my first ever CyberSci and it was such a fun and challenging experience. I had spend the majority of the time working on forensics problem and trying to solve old IBM punchcards and mapping a sequence of dots in a certain pattern to letters and characters. So proud of our team and looking to enjoying many more roadtrips with the squad. The writeups and notes from this CyberSci will come later on... stay tuned.
